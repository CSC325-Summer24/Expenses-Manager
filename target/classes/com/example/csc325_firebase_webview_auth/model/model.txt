Model
Model classes are non-visual classes that encapsulate the app's data.
Therefore, the model can be thought of as representing the app's domain model,
which usually includes a data model along with business and validation logic.
Examples of model objects include data transfer objects (DTOs), Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs),
and generated entity and proxy objects.

Model classes are typically used in conjunction with services or repositories that encapsulate data access and caching.
