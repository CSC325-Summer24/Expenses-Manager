//ViewModel
 //The view model implements properties and commands to which the view can data bind to,
 // and notifies the view of any state changes through change notification events.
 // The properties and commands that the view model provides define the functionality
 //to be offered by the UI, but the view determines how that functionality is to be displayed.
